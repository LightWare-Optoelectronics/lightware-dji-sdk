As mentioned earlier, the deck of the boat moves along six degrees of freedom (three axes of translation and three axes of rotation), although some movements may be less pronounced than others. This constant motion reduces the window of opportunity for the drone to safely execute a landing.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"landing-moving-platform/software":{"id":"landing-moving-platform/software","title":"Software","description":"Payload SDK & Raspberry Pi","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"landing-moving-platform/summary":{"id":"landing-moving-platform/summary","title":"Summary","description":"This scenario is a guide to adding a critical capability to the DJI M350 drone - enabling it to land on a moving platform. Landing on a moving platform is not a default feature available from DJI. This extends the capability of a DJI drone to various platforms, including ground, aerial, or marine vehicles. For the purposes of this guide, the focus will be on a marine context, as it presents a relatable, but complex use case.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
